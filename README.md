# mobile_tech_challenge_plotting

A flutter project made as a challenge for a job application's technical test.

The challenge is meant to be done in 4 hours and I couldn't manage to get to the end of it.

Implemented the first version of a Bloc to get the data needed for the rest of the challenge.

Plotted the data.

Next step would have been to allow for selection of data from a start to an end date.
